# Hello World

**Hello World** is a popular resource used to demonstrate the basic syntax and structure of a programming language or development environment. The Azion Hello World template deploys an edge application that prints the text "Hello, World!" in your browser and you can use it as a starting point to become familiar with Azion Edge Platform and edge computing capabilities.

This repository is an example of the new GitHub repository created during the deployment. For a detailed step-by-step to deploy this template through Azion's platform, check the [How to deploy the Hello World template](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/hello-world-template/) guide.
